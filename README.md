# üß™ rahul-sandbox

Welcome to my engineering sandbox ‚Äî a growing collection of hands-on experiments and learning projects across backend systems, real-time media, and AI integrations.

While I‚Äôve been building systems and prototypes for years, I‚Äôve only recently started organizing and publishing them on GitHub. This repo marks the beginning of that journey. It serves as my personal playground to explore emerging technologies, sharpen system design thinking, and build full-stack proof-of-concepts.

It embraces a learning-by-doing philosophy ‚Äî intentionally iterative, occasionally messy, and always focused on growth through building.

## üîç What's Inside

| Folder               | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `media-ui`           | A React + Next.js based UI for real-time audio interaction (TTS, WebSocket) |
| `quarkus-amazon-s3`  | Quarkus based service demonstrating sync/async file ops with S3             |
| *(more coming...)*   | New experiments in Rails, LLMs, agentic AI and system design in progress    |           |

## üß∞ This sandbox includes and will continue to evolve with work involving:

- **Backend frameworks** ‚Äì Quarkus (Java), FastAPI (Python), Ruby on Rails (ongoing)
- **Frontend experiments** ‚Äì React (hooks, forms, state), Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Real-time systems** ‚Äì WebSockets, gRPC, Kafka, Redis Streams
- **Cloud & DevOps** ‚Äì Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (S3, EKS), MinIO (S3-compatible), NATS (JetStream)
- **AI & ML Integration** ‚Äì Hosted Whisper, LangChain, LLaMA 3, NVIDIA NeMo, LangGraph, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, agentic workflows, smart summarization tools, and LLM-friendly web scrapers for auto-tagging and metadata extraction
- **System design & tooling** ‚Äì Service decomposition patterns, OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, CI/CD pipelines for automation, and local-first development setups to streamline iteration and debugging.
- **Developer utilities** ‚Äì CLI tools, API scaffolding, observability dashboards, VictoriaMetrics for time-series monitoring

## üöÄ Why This Exists

I'm an engineer who learns best by building things. This repository is:

- A sandbox to experiment, prototype, and occasionally break things in the pursuit of understanding  
- A collection of work-in-progress ideas, side projects, and technical explorations  
- A space where curiosity meets code ‚Äî spanning across stacks, domains, and emerging patterns
